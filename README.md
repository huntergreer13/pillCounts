Pre-Work (Ignore this if you're just running the program)

2. Install Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/


## To Run Program:
1. Click 'Start' button and search for 'Command Prompt' (NOT node.js command prompt!). Open Command Prompt.
2. In Command Prompt, type the following commands:

```
cd /d C:\Users\Operator\Desktop

node count.js "myFileName.MEDS"
```

Note that you will only need to type the cd command (the first one listed) once when you open Command Prompt. Then the node command line (the second one listed) may be run infinite times until Command Prompt is closed.
