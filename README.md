# pillCounts

Pre-Work (Ignore this if you're just running the program)

1. Save count.js to filepath C:\Users\Operator\Desktop 

2. Install Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Install WampServer at http://www.wampserver.com/en/ and download the index.html file to the www/count folder. Start WampServer. If it fails, you may need to right-click on the W icon at the bottom, Tools, port used by apache, use a port other than 80, and use port 7080.

4. In Internet Explorer, click on settings, internet options, security tab. Select local intranet. Click custom level button, enable "Initialize and script Activex controls not marked as safe for scripting" option


## To Run Program:
1. Click 'Start' button and search for 'Command Prompt' (NOT node.js command prompt!). Open Command Prompt.
2. In Command Prompt, type the following commands:

```
cd /d C:\Users\Operator\Desktop

node count.js "myFileName.MEDS"
```

Note that you will only need to type the cd command (the first one listed) once when you open Command Prompt. Then the node command line (the second one listed) may be run infinite times until Command Prompt is closed.
